Before 2022, I fantasized a lot about the quality of education in Europe, imagining it to be highly advanced, innovative, and superior in nurturing creativity and critical thinking skills. This perception was shaped by stories I heard and the portrayal of European education systems in various media. However, my perspective shifted when I experienced it firsthand. Let me walk you through an incident I experienced with my kiddo a few weeks ago.

During the Christmas holidays, I was thinking of relaxing a bit after a tiring year. As usual, my wife asked me for a favor to help our kid with a chapter in Physics: "Electricity." It is one of my favorite topics since childhood. So I rolled up my sleeves and started asking basic questions like: What do you mean by electricity? What happens when you say the electric current is live in a circuit? What is a circuit? etc. And the response was absolute silence. Then I asked how this topic was taught in class. Kiddo replied, "The teacher takes us to the lab, gives some intro in 5 minutes, and asks us to create some circuits." This approach, while well-intentioned, often leaves students struggling to grasp the fundamentals. Without a clear explanation of the  underlying concepts, many students simply follow steps mechanically, missing the opportunity to understand the 'why' and 'how' behind the activity. As a result, learning outcomes are uneven, benefiting only those who already have prior knowledge or have prepared in advance. I asked if the teacher looks into the circuits made by the group of students. The teacher does that. Then what is wrong here? The problem is everyone is doing a gamble in the lab. Apart from a few kids who prepare at home upfront for the class, only they can understand what's going to happen in the lab. The rest of the students are in la-la land.

After a 4-day exercise of learning, my kiddo understood what electricity is, how electrons travel in a circuit, and more. We started by drawing simple diagrams to visualize how circuits work, using household items like batteries, bulbs, and wires to build actual circuits. I also created small quizzes with scenarios like "what happens if a wire is disconnected?" to stimulate curiosity. Through hands-on practice and consistent reinforcement, my kiddo grasped the key concepts effectively. Also, to my surprise, this teacher had "taught" about series and parallel circuits!!! After my help, kiddo was able to recognize what series and parallel circuits are. At least the notion of "parallel" was changed to "branching" for the parallel circuits.

Throughout the process, what puzzled me was that it doesn't matter if you are from the eastern part of the world or the west. The attitude of the majority of teachers is the same. No wonder why kids start hating math and some of the core subjects in science. To address this, teachers could focus on more interactive teaching methods, such as engaging students with hands-on activities, encouraging collaborative group projects, and providing real-world examples that make complex topics relatable and interesting. Personalized attention to students struggling with core concepts could also go a long way in building their confidence and interest.  

I won't say all teachers are the same; some are really awesome in my kiddo's class. But there are some who teach with an "I don't care" attitude. It's just a job for them. A lecturer-style class for kids who are learning physics for the first time is a disaster in my opinion.
