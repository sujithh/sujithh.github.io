Life has changed, my career has taken a different path, but the state of my table remains the same—organized chaos.

While helping my kid organize their study table, I was struck by memories of my own workspace back when I was working   
as an embedded engineer. My table looked something like this ![old desk](/assets/images/final_old_desk.jpeg "Old Desk").

Despite the limited space, it held:
- 3 monitors
- A beast of a laptop running Windows with virtual boxes for any flavor of GNU/Linux
- At least two or three embedded boards
- An SD card reader
- A docking station
- Six LoWPAN devices
- An Ethernet switch
- A webcam
- A wifi adapter
- Tiger balm (a necessity I couldn’t avoid!)
- And so much more...

Now, as a web developer, my table tells a different story. Here’s what it looks like this ![current desk](/assets/images/my_current_desk.jpeg "Current Desk").

Instead of devices, there are books scattered around. Thankfully, I don’t have dual monitors anymore.

Even though my table might seem cluttered, I’ve always had a clear mental map of where everything is. Cleaning it up has never been a problem for me. But for anyone else, it might look like chaos. Disconnect one cable, and I’d immediately notice—my eyes would go wild!
